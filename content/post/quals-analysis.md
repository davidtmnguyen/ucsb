Old quals: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1v4A0GzFvfHd0dNQVFKX1VpOTA).
You'll need to be logged in to your UC Connect (GMail) account to access them.
The exams are offered twice a year, at beginning of fall quarter (before classes start) and at the end of spring quarter (week 9). See the 
<a href="http://math.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.math.d7/files/sitefiles/graduate/grad_handbook_0.pdf" target="_blank">Graduate Program Handbook</a>
for more information on qualifying exams.

If you're an *incomming student*, I highly recommend spending 
the whole summer to study for *all* three of them and take them when come here for fall quarter. 
Why would you want to do that? Because they are a pain in the neck if you haven't passed them. 
Trust me, it is worth sacrificing your summer for this. (If you only want to do one, most people take the Topology exam.) Feel free to email me if you have any questions or want some tips on how to prepare.


Below are *(very rough)* solutions of old qual problems. Good luck and have fun!
